/**
 * Save a shared link WITHOUT the user having to look at SaveHere.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE POINT OF THIS FILE. A share is an interruption of something else —
 * you are mid-scroll in Instagram, you want the reel kept, you want to carry on
 * scrolling. Routing that to /save and making the user watch a progress screen
 * breaks exactly the flow the feature exists to protect. Nothing here needs a
 * decision from them: the URL is known, the save is unconditional, and the
 * summary was always asynchronous anyway.
 *
 * ⚠️ PHASE A. Android still LAUNCHES the app to deliver ACTION_SEND, so there
 * is a brief flash of SaveHere before it hands control back. Removing that
 * needs a translucent no-display Activity (a custom config plugin + Kotlin),
 * which is Phase B. iOS needs a Share Extension plus an App Group to share the
 * session — blocked on the Apple Developer account. This module is written so
 * both of those become "call `saveSharedLink` from somewhere else" rather than
 * a rewrite.

 * keeps the user in SaveHere, which is the exact thing this feature exists to
 * avoid. The save is already committed by this point; only the caption is at
 * stake, and the server re-summarises on demand.
