/**
 * How close this library is to the save ceiling, and what to say about it.
 *
 * The cap is per tier (owner, 2026-09-11): 50 free, 500 on trial and pro.
 * `backend/app/config.py` holds both numbers and the client is TOLD its own
 * rather than knowing any of them — a client that hardcodes a limit disagrees
 * with the server the first time the server changes.
 *
 * ⚠️ THRESHOLDS ARE RATIOS, AND THAT IS WHAT SAVED THEM. They were written as
 * 90%/95% while the cap was briefly 1000-for-everyone, so the owner's "warn at
 * 900, interrupt at 950" landed as fractions. When the cap became 50/500 an
 * hour later, nothing here needed touching: free warns at 45 and interrupts at
 * 48, pro at 450 and 475. Hardcoded 900s would have meant a free user hitting a
 * refused save having never once been warned.
 *
 * Nothing here upsells. At 48/50 that is genuinely useful information, but the
 * band this renders into is one line on the library screen — the once-per-
 * session alert is where Pro gets mentioned (app/index.tsx), and the server's
 * own 403 says it too, tier-aware.
