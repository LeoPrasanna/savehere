     *
     * The tile's height must come from `aspectRatio` against its width, and
     * nothing else. `flex: 1` means `flexBasis: 0; flexGrow: 1`, which is a
     * COMPETING opinion about that same height whenever the parent is a
     * column — and in the masonry it is. Two rules for one dimension, and
     * which one wins is a Yoga implementation detail.
     *
     * ⚠️ IT WON DIFFERENTLY AFTER THE SDK 57 / RN 0.86.2 UPGRADE. Under RN
     * 0.85 aspectRatio won and the grid was right; a note here even said so.
     * After the upgrade flex won, so tiles DIVIDED their column's height
     * instead of deriving it: a column holding one tile stretched that tile to
     * the full height of the tallest column, a column holding two gave each
     * half. That is the giant tile beside two squashed ones, the black
     * letterbox bands (the image keeps `cover` inside a frame of the wrong
     * shape), and the titles colliding. Nothing about the grid's own maths
     * changed — the tile's height rule did.
     *
     * ⚠️ WHY THE CARD CANNOT JUST CARRY `flex: 1` FOR EVERYONE. In
     * `app/rediscover.tsx` the parent is a FlatList ROW, where flex is the
     * WIDTH axis and IS needed to divide the row evenly. That is the grid's
     * job, not the card's, so Rediscover now wraps each card in its own
     * `flex: 1` view and the card stays purely "as wide as I am given, as tall
     * as my ratio says". One rule per dimension, in one place.
