/**
 * The hero slot.
 *
 * ⚠️ REWRITTEN 2026-08-10. This used to hold six ABSTRACT figures built from
 * the system's primitives — a 3x3 cell grid, stacked bars, rows of dots, a
 * giant plus. Defensible as composition, and the owner's verdict after
 * watching first-run was blunt: they don't read. Rows of dots do not say
 * "workout", and numbered bars do not say "recipe".
 *
 * They are now the app's OWN icons, and that is the point rather than a
 * fallback: four of these six glyphs are the tab bar the user will tap within
 * the minute (`layers` = Library, `ask` = Ask, `checkbox` = Slate, `add` =
 * Save), and the other two are the buttons the steps describe (`barbell` =
 * Build Workout, `restaurant` = Get Recipe, both in app/reel/[id].tsx). So the
 * tour now teaches the actual interface instead of decorating next to it. The
 * `save` step was always the one figure that worked — because it was already a
 * giant version of the Save button's plus. This applies that logic to the rest.
 *
 * Zero new imports, zero new icon keys, zero bytes added to the bundle.
 * (Canva-generated artwork was evaluated for this and rejected: raster only,
 * no transparent export on the current plan, so it could not survive the
 * light/dark inversion. See TODO.md.)
 *
 * Fixed 1:1 so the slot never reflows between steps.
