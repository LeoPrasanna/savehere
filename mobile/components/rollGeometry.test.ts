/**
 * Run with:  npm run test:roll
 *
 * No framework, same as todoMerge.test.ts. This pins the one rule that the
 * "Slate lines are cut off" bug kept violating: a rolling line may never
 * travel further than the slack around it, because the viewport clips.
 *
 * Both previous attempts at this bug edited the QUOTES. That only ever worked
 * by accident — it made some of them fit on one line, where there happened to
 * be enough slack. These cases are written in the real numbers the app uses so
 * a future viewport or lineHeight change fails here instead of on a phone.

// The Slate quote roller as it shipped: 42px viewport, two 18px lines.
// 36px of text in a 42px window is 3px of slack, and it was translating 22px.
assert.equal(

assert.equal(
  rollTravel(60, 18, 2),

/* ── the shapes that were always fine, and must stay fine ────────────────── */

// One line in the compact roller: 21px of slack, so a near-full roll and
// nowhere near the ceiling. (Written as 22 first — the slack is (60-18)/2 = 21,
// which is exactly the sort of off-by-one this file exists to catch.)
assert.equal(
  rollTravel(60, 18, 1),
  21,
  'a single compact line has slack to spare and rolls almost the full distance',

// The library capability roll: 42px viewport, ONE 18px line. Never clipped,
// and it must keep its 42px footprint (it replaced the search field).
assert.equal(
  rollTravel(42, 18, 1),
  12,
  'the library roll is one line in 42px and rolls without clipping',

// Text exactly fills the viewport: nothing may move.
assert.equal(rollTravel(36, 18, 2), 0, 'no slack means no travel — a crossfade, not a slice');

// Text OVERFLOWS the viewport. Travel must clamp to 0, never go negative
// (a negative would invert the roll's direction, which is worse than static).
assert.equal(rollTravel(30, 18, 2), 0, 'overflowing text still yields zero travel, never negative');

// Enormous viewport: capped, so the roll never becomes a slide.
