/**
 * The home screen — "editorial hero" (variant D7, owner-selected 2026-08-03).
 *
 * ── What this replaced, and why ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The old landing stacked a greeting, a rolling tip, an Ask row, a to-do block
 * with two columns, a category chip strip, a recent carousel and a four-line
 * disclaimer. Every one of those was defensible alone; together they were a
 * menu of eight destinations on a screen the user opens to do ONE thing.
 *
 * This is a statement and a single input. Everything the old screen linked to is
 * a tab away — Library, Slate and Ask are all in the tab bar now, so repeating
 * them here was pure duplication. The category chips duplicated the Library's
 * own filter; the disclaimer moved to where it is actually read.
 *
 * ── The one idea worth preserving ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE INPUT NEVER MOVES, and as of 2026-08-10 it never changes job either:
 *
 *     0 saves        paste a link      "Save it. Then ask it."
 *     1..MIN-1       paste a link      "…and two to go."   + unlock ticks
 *     MIN+           paste a link      "You saved it. Now use it."
 *
 * ⚠️ The composer used to become an "ASK YOUR LIBRARY" button at MIN+ saves.
 * The owner removed it (2026-08-10): Ask is a tab, and the home screen has one
 * action. The three-state ladder survives because it describes the LIBRARY, not
 * the button — `ASK_MIN_REELS` is still a real server-enforced gate
 * (app/ask.tsx enforces it independently), so the unlock ticks still tell the
 * truth about when the Ask tab starts working. Threshold is imported, never
 * hardcoded.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO SERIF. The approved mockup rendered the hero in a serif face; the app is
 * one family (Inter) and the owner asked for strict consistency in the same
 * breath. "Editorial" here is the composition — one large left-aligned
 * statement, a quiet supporting line, a pinned action — not a second typeface.
 */

/** Both taps hand off to a screen that already owns the job — this screen holds
 *  no paste or ask logic of its own, so there is one implementation of each. */
