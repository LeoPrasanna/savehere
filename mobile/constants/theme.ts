/**
 * Findable design system — "Contact Sheet".
 *
 * ── Reference lock (Refero, 2026-08-01) ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Primary:  Julia Krantz (juliakrantz.com) — "darkroom contact sheet": a grid of
 *           photographic tiles on absolute #000, identity spelled in barely-there
 *           light letterforms. Its governing rule is the one that reshapes this
 *           whole file: "Color is entirely absent from the UI layer; all
 *           chromatic interest is delegated to the photography."
 * Borrow:   mono (mono.frm.fm) — the GHOST OUTLINE control: transparent fill,
 *           1px border, 0 radius, wide horizontal padding, no filled CTA colour.
 *           entire studios — small tracked uppercase utility labels as the
 *           navigation/metadata voice instead of icons.
 * Reject:   any hue in the chrome · rounded corners · shadows/elevation ·
 *           gradients on controls · filled colour CTAs · a hue per category ·
 *           weight above 500 · decorative entry animation.
 *
 * ── Why this replaced a colour-first system ──────────────────────────────────
 * The outgoing direction rotated four saturated brand colours across card
 * surfaces. Findable's cards are THUMBNAILS — every one arrives with its own
 * palette, and brand colour on the surface around them fought all of it. Here
 * the chrome is achromatic on purpose so the user's saved content is the only
 * colour on screen. That is the whole thesis; do not add an accent "just for
 * the primary button".
 *
 * ── Roles (do not repurpose) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   ink        The single foreground. All text, all icons, all borders.
 *   ash        Secondary hierarchy. Labels, counts, metadata. Never body copy.
 *   ghostLine  Structural seams ONLY — tile borders, dividers, rules.
 *   veil       Decorative overlay text on photography (the archival index).
 *              Meaningful overlay text uses `ink` over `scrim`, never veil.
 *   canvas     Absolute. #000 in dark, #FFF in light. Never a "near" value.
 *
 * NOTE: token names are a stable API — screens import these by name. Every name
 * the old system exported still resolves, so the look changes app-wide without
 * ~30 call sites being edited. Add tokens freely; rename only with a sweep.

 * direction was briefed against, whose controls are pills and whose fields are
 * ~10px rounded rectangles.
 *
 * So the rule is now: CONTROLS AND SURFACES CURVE, PHOTOGRAPHS DO NOT.
 *   - buttons, chips, the tab bar          → `full` (pill)
 *   - fields, cards, banners, modals       → `sm`–`lg`
 *   - grid tiles, the hero image           → still 0, hardcoded at the call
 *     site. A rounded photo in a tight mosaic reads as a sticker, and the
 *     reference grid is square-cornered; keep it that way.
 *
 * Because ~30 call sites already ask for `radius.full`, flipping this constant
 * turned them all back into pills in one move rather than 30 edits.

 * Now/Neue Haas Grotesk: same neutral skeleton, no signature quirks, and it
 * ships every weight this needs through `@expo-google-fonts/inter`.
 *
 * This REPLACED Space Grotesk + DM Sans at weight 300. That pairing came from
 * the primary style reference (Julia Krantz), whose signature is a
 * nearly-invisible light letterform — a portfolio move that reads as elegant on
 * a desktop contact sheet and as under-inked on a phone. Inter at 400/500/600
 * is the deliberate trade: less rarefied, considerably more legible at the
 * 10–13px label sizes this system leans on, and it is what the owner asked for.
 *
 * `serif` / `serifBlack` are kept as KEYS resolving to Inter so the ~8 call
 * sites asking for a serif stop rendering Fraunces without being edited.
