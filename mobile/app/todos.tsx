            LAYOUT CHANGE: the goal bar used to run the full width of this card
            with nobody's name on it. It is now the right-hand column of a
            two-column head, with the picked face and the display name on the
            left — so the row reads "PRASANNA · today's goal · 1/5" instead of
            an unattributed statistic.

            This is also the only place on the to-do screen the chosen avatar
            appears. The hero above rolls through NAMES FOR THE LIST ("Order of
            the Day", "Docket") — never the user's own name — so nothing here
            duplicates it.

            The head renders unconditionally; only the bar inside it is gated,
            so switching the daily goal off in settings (TodoGoalBar returns
            null) leaves a clean identity row rather than a dangling face.
