   * refresh collapsed the grid back to 24 — the ScrollView's content shrank
   * under the thumb and the offset clamped, dumping you near the top.

   * That is not a rare path. `load()` runs on screen focus, on `appResumed`,
   * on `libraryState`, on pull-to-refresh — and **every 4 seconds while any
   * summary is pending**, which is exactly when a user is scrolling a library
   * they just added to. Infinite scroll and the poll were fighting: `loadMore`
   * appended 24, the poll threw them away.

   * update at all, because the poll only ever re-read the first page.)

   *     each tick. The memo comparator absorbs that, but it is work done 100+
   *     times to learn that nothing changed.
   *  3. It only ever read the FIRST page, so a pending reel below position 24
   *     never received its summary at all — it just sat there saying "READING"
   *     until you left the screen.
   *
   * One `getReel` per pending id fixes all three. In practice that is a single
   * small request (you rarely have more than one summary in flight), and the
   * patch is applied in place: same length, same order, same aspects, so
   * nothing reflows and only the one card that changed re-renders.

        {/* ── The mosaic ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
            Tiles are staggered, not aligned into rows: each one goes to
            whichever column is currently shortest, so neighbours sit at
            different heights the way a real contact sheet does.

            ponytail: a ScrollView, not a FlatList — EVERY loaded tile is
            mounted, so the native view count grows with the library (roughly a
            dozen views per card: frame, pressable, image, scrim, overlay,
            three texts). `removeClippedSubviews` below is what keeps that
            affordable; it is load-bearing, not a micro-optimisation.

            ⚠️ AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS NOTE CLAIMED VIRTUALIZATION WAS
            IMPOSSIBLE HERE — "masonry and row virtualization are incompatible
            without measuring every tile". That is no longer true, and it would
            have sent the next person down the wrong road. Tile geometry in this
            grid is fully DETERMINISTIC before layout: `aspectFor(reel)` hashes
            the id, and the column width comes from `columnsForWidth(width)`. So
            every tile's exact height and y-offset is computable without
            measuring anything. If this ever needs windowing, that is the
            opening — not a third-party grid.

            It is still not worth doing yet: the screen paginates 24 at a time,
            and nothing has been profiled on a real device. Do that first. */}

             It was added the same day, on Android only, to detach off-screen
             tiles from the native hierarchy — and the note justifying it also
             admitted the prop "blanks content in exactly this shape" on iOS,
             a nested column layout. Hours later the owner reported the phone
             grid mangled. It is not proven to be the cause (the frame's
             flex/aspectRatio conflict is the other suspect and was fixed in
             the same change), but it bought a scroll improvement that was
             explicitly "reasoned, not observed" — no FPS number was ever
             claimed for it. Unmeasured gain, live visual regression: it goes.
             Put it back only behind a Performance Monitor reading that shows
             the native view count actually hurting. */
