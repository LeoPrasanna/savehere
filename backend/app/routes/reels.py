    be stuck 'Summarizing…' forever. Called once on startup. Bounded so a backlog
    can't trigger a cost spike; anything beyond the cap is left for manual retry.

    ONE free recovery per reel, enforced by the `recovered_at` stamp. This path

    without decrementing anyone's allowance or showing up in the usage meter,
    and Render's free tier cold-starts constantly. A row that could never
    complete was re-summarized free and invisibly on EVERY boot, forever.
