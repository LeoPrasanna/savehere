"""Tier entitlements — the single source of truth for what a user may do.

Three effective tiers:

  pro    app_metadata.tier == "pro" (server-stamped: scripts/set_tier.py now,
         the RevenueCat webhook at launch). Unlimited saves, AI_PRO_DAILY_LIMIT.
  trial  free account inside its trial window (TRIAL_DAYS from the first
         authenticated request + trial_extra_days). Unlimited saves,
         AI_DAILY_LIMIT per day.
  free   trial expired. Library stays fully usable (view/search/notes/delete);
         AI_FREE_DAILY_LIMIT per day (a trickle, not zero — a dead app
         uninstalls, a limited app upsells).

⚠️ SAVE_LIMIT IS THE SAME ON ALL THREE (owner, 2026-09-11). It used to be 20 on
free and unlimited on trial/pro, which made saves the main upgrade lever. It is
now 1000 everywhere — a storage ceiling, not a paywall. `save_limit` stays
`int | None` because the enforcement points already branch on None and an
unlimited tier may come back; nothing sets None today.

The trial clock lives server-side (ProfileDB) so the client can't forge it, and
is keyed to a hash of the normalized email (TrialGrantDB) so deleting the
account or re-signing up with you+2@gmail.com continues the ORIGINAL trial
instead of starting a fresh one. Every enforcement point (AI quota charge, the
save cap, the usage endpoint) calls `entitlements_for` — never duplicate the
tier math elsewhere.
