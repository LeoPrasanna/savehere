    # with ₹99 / $7 per month (history: 100 -> 20 -> 25 -> 15 -> 20).
    # ⚠️ This is a DELIBERATE cross-subsidy, not a break-even number. At
    # ~$0.004/action, 20/day is ~$2.43/mo worst case: $7 nets $5.95 after Apple's
    # 15% and clears it ~2.4x, but ₹99 nets ~$0.96 — a maxing INR Pro user costs

    # volume and cover it from US margin, revisit after 6 months.
    # ⚠️ RAISING this number makes the INR gap WIDER, never narrower — the cap IS
    # the worst case. ₹99 breaks even at ~8/day. The levers are a lower cap or a
    # higher price; if it ever needs closing, the seam is a storefront-specific
    # tier (daily_limit_for() in quota.py already branches on tier — one constant
    # plus a "pro_in" stamp), not a tweak here.

    # is a cost argument, not a design one, and it has not gone away: the
    # 2026-07-24 study puts break-even at ~4.2% conversion gated vs ~7.8%
